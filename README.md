## Project Structure

Here is an overview of the project structure:

```
├── app
│   ├── page.tsx
│   └── ...
├── public
│   ├── ...
├── styles
│   ├── ...
├── README.md
└── ...
```

- The `app` directory contains the main application code, including the `page.tsx` file which you can modify to edit the page.
- The `public` directory is used for static assets such as images or fonts.
- The `styles` directory contains CSS or SCSS files for styling the application.

Feel free to explore and modify other files and directories as needed.

## Getting Started

To start the development server, run one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Once the server is running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result. The page will automatically update as you make changes to the files.
